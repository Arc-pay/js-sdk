# Arc Pay JavaScript SDK

Browser and server SDK for Arc Pay integrations.

## Install

```sh
npm install @thavguard/arc-pay
```

## Browser SDK

```ts
import { ArcPay } from "@thavguard/arc-pay/js";

const arcpay = await ArcPay.load("pk_test_...", {
  apiBase: "https://api.arcpay.space",
});
const elements = arcpay.elements();
```

`ArcPay.load()` takes the publishable key as the first argument. Sandbox/live is
inferred from the key prefix (`pk_test_` or `pk_live_`); pass `apiBase` only when
testing against a non-default API host.

## React Bindings

```ts
import { ArcPayProvider, useArcPay } from "@thavguard/arc-pay/react";
```

## Server SDK

```ts
import { createArcPayClient } from "@thavguard/arc-pay/server";

const client = createArcPayClient({
  secretKey: "sk_test_...",
});
```

Amounts are integer minor units. Never pass card PAN or CVV to server APIs; use Hosted Fields for browser card entry.

Browser pages using Hosted Fields must allow frames from `https://sdk.arcpay.space`
and API connections to `https://api.arcpay.space`. If your Content Security
Policy also governs telemetry, allow connections to your configured Sentry ingest
host or disable browser telemetry at your application layer.
